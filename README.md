# Nexora Frontend

Nexora is a B2B competitive price-intelligence workspace. This frontend provides authentication, tenant-aware catalog management, competitor/source administration, product matching, website discovery, live collection runs, job visibility, alerts, and account settings.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Set `VITE_API_URL` to the Nexora backend origin, for example `http://localhost:8000`.

The production build is served as a static SPA and is container-ready through the included Dockerfile. Pass `--build-arg VITE_API_URL=https://your-api.example.com` when building for a non-local backend.
